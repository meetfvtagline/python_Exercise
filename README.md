🐍 Python Exercise

📌 Exercise 1: Check Multiples

Task:
Write a Python program to check whether a given integer (from terminal input) is a multiple of:

5 and 7

10

56

📌 Exercise 2: Factorial Using Recursion

Task:
Write a Python program to compute the factorial of a number using recursion.
Input must be taken from the terminal.

📌 Exercise 3: Matrix Transpose

Task:
Given a 3×4 matrix like:

[[1, 2, 3, 4],  
 [5, 6, 7, 8],  
 [9, 10, 11, 12]]


Output the transposed matrix:

[[1, 5, 9],  
 [2, 6, 10],  
 [3, 7, 11],  
 [4, 8, 12]]

📌 Exercise 4: Extract and Multiply Even Elements (One-Line Code)

Task:
For an input array (taken from terminal), find the even elements and multiply each even number by 2.
One-line code requirement:

No for loop

No if statement
Example:
Input:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


Output:

[4, 8]

📌 Exercise 5: Remove NaN Values

Task:
Given the following input (no user input required):

[56.2, float('NaN'), 51.7, 55.3, 52.5, float('NaN'), 47.8]


Output should remove all NaN values:

[56.2, 51.7, 55.3, 52.5, 47.8]

📌 Exercise 6: Flatten a List (List Comprehension + For Loop)

Task:
Flatten a 2D list into a 1D list using list comprehension. No input required.
Example:
Input:

[[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]


Output:

[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

📌 Exercise 7: Sum of Last Elements of Each Row

Task:
Take matrix input from the terminal and compute the sum of the last element in each row.
Example:
Input:

[[8, 14, -6], [12,7,4], [-11,3,21]]


Output:

19
