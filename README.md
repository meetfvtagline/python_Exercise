1. Python Exercise (4 Hours)
Python program to check whether the given integer is a multiple of 5 and 7, and 10, 56.
   	 Note: Input should be taken from the terminal.

Python program to find the factorial of a number using recursion.
 Note: Input should be taken from the terminal.

Consider the following example of a 3x4 matrix implemented as a list of 3 lists of length.
For example:
	Input:
 [
   [1, 2, 3, 4],
   [5, 6, 7, 8],
   [9, 10, 11, 12],
 ]

Output:
[[1, 5, 9], [2, 6, 10], [3, 7, 11], [4, 8, 12]]


2. Find the even elements from an array. Respectively multiply this element in the array.
            For example:
Input:
 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Output 
 [4,8]

Note: Need one line code, don't use for loop and if statement.
Input should be taken from the terminal
	

3. Write a program.
For example:
    Input
    [56.2, float('NaN'), 51.7, 55.3, 52.5, float('NaN'), 47.8]

    Output 
   [56.2, 51.7, 55.3, 52.5, 47.8]

Note: No need to input


4. Flatten a list using list comprehension and for a loop.
For example:
   Input:
   [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]

   Output: 
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] 

	Note: No need to input.


5. To read the last element from each row and sum of the all last elements.
For example:
	Input
[[8, 14, -6], [12,7,4], [-11,3,21]]

Output 
19
	 Note: Input should be taken from the terminal.



6. Flatten a list using list comprehension and for a loop.
For example:
   Input:
   [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]

   Output: 
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] 

	Note: No need to input.

For example:
	Input
[[8, 14, -6], [12,7,4], [-11,3,21]]

Output 
19
